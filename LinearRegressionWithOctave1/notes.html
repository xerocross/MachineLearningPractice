    <h1>Linear Regression with Octave 1</h1>

    <p>Given data of the form (x,y), for example x the size of a house in square feet and y the price at which it sold, we try to fit a linear <em>hypothesis</em> function h(x) = y that can be used to estimate price as a function of size.  So we try to find constants &theta;<sub>0</sub> and &theta;<sub>1</sub> so that h(x) = &theta;<sub>0</sub> + &theta;<sub>0</sub>x is a good fit.</p>
    
    <p>Data from the training set will be written as a list of ordered pairs in the form (x<sup>(i)</sup>, y<sup>(i)</sup>).</p>
    
    <p>In this situation, the set of possible output values is a continuous range, and we call this regression.  When the output is a discrete set of possibilities, that is a classification problem.</p>
